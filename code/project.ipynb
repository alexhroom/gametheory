    "The trader can either do a regular trade, $\\mathcal{T}_r$ which has a small reward and no risk of being caught by the regulator, or an inside trade $\\mathcal{T}_I$ which has a much higher reward but, if caught by the regulator, will lead to harsh penalties.\n",
    "\n",
    "The regulator can choose not to regulate $\\mathcal{R}_n$, which has a small benefit if no inside trading takes place (as they're doing their job properly) and a penalty if inside trading is taking place (as inside trading has been detected, but they don't know who's doing it!). Or, they can regulate $\\mathcal{R}_r$, which has a financial cost if done when unnecessary, but a reward if they catch an inside trader."
