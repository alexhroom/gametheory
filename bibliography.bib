% models insider trading and regulators as a sequential game
% trader has three choices:
% - riskless asset with small return
% - risky market with good return
% - insider trades with even better return
% trader is also penalised for increasing portfolio risk
% supervisors' utilities are based on probability of conviction vs cost of investigation
% the minimum level of effort required for insider trading to be detected is a random variable 'drawn by nature'
% and supervisor also has a fixed cost of monitoring etc.
% we'd have to heavily simplify this model as here they require Monte Carlo for finding the Nash equilibrium

% utility model of lying w.r.t. psychological and monetary factors:
% monetary benefit of truth-telling is m_t, of lying m_t', so utility of a lie is m_t' - m_t
% compares monetary benefit to a 'C_i' parameter of 'ethics'
% also has probability of being caught in a lie as p_i, and the 'fear' of getting caught as a function f(m_t', m_t, p_i) which increases in m_t' - m_t and p_i
% a good way of modelling 'risk' with insider trading (both financial risk and legal risk)
