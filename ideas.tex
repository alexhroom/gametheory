\section{Methods}

We stage our scenario as a normal form game, with:
\begin{itemize}
\item Two players: a trader $\mathcal{T}$, and a trading regulator $\mathcal{R}$, who are the row and column players respectively;
\item The trader's actions as a 'regular' trade vs an 'insider' trade;
\item The regulator's actions as 'no investigation' vs 'investigation';
\item And financial payoff matrices for both players as follows;
\end{itemize}
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
    \mathcal{T} = 
    \begin{pmatrix}
    1 & 1 \\
    4 & -5
    \end{pmatrix}
\end{split}
\quad\quad
\begin{split}
    \mathcal{R} = 
    \begin{pmatrix}
    1 & -2 \\
    -3 & 5
    \end{pmatrix}
\end{split}
\end{equation*}

i.e. a 'normal' trade has a small financial gain, but is immune to investigation - an insider trade, on the other hand, is much more lucrative but sustains heavy fines if caught. For the regulator, they lose out bureaucratically on 'false positive' investigations and on failing to catch insider traders\footnote{Statistical methods such as those in \citet{bris2005insider} can recognise that insider trading has occurred, but not who is doing it.}, but are heavily rewarded for catching fraud. 

\subsection{Information}
In the strategies, we had to note that the two players do not have equal information. The trader always knows when they have been investigated, but the regulator only knows the trader has done inside trading if they have caught them doing it! Compare this to the Prisoner's Dilemma - here, one player can recognise the other player defecting, but the other can only recognise simultaneous defection.
